# Overwriting the serial number on a Tolino

This is probably the easiest "hack" on this page:

1. Connect your Tolino via USB to a computer.
2. Create a file called "serialno".
3. Put any serial number you want into it.
4. Reboot your Tolino.

Please note that such a change can be detected server-side and lead to online functionality being removed.

To revert it, just delete the "serialno" file.
