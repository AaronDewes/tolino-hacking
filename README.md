# A Tolino hacking guide

This site will soon contain some information on how to hack Tolino e-readers running Firmware 15.2.0.


This isn't an official Tolino website and it's in no way affiliated with tolino media.

### What you'll find here

- Accessing ADB (*)
- Accessing fastboot (*)
- Opening the developer options (*)
- Viewing hidden information in the settings
- [Overwriting the serial number](serial-number.md)
- [Changing the browser start page](resellerConfig.md)
- Hopefully more soon

(*): I've only found information regarding this for Android 4.4-based models.

All information on this page does only work on Firmware 15.2.0. Any later or older version may not work,
and the way to apply these modifications is likely to change as Tolino tries to make the hacks I propose harder.


So far, I've always found a way around it and also made more modifications possible whenever they tried to block something, but keep in mind that after every update, it can take some time until I find new ways to hack the software.

For any permanent change, this page will also explain a way to revert it, so don't worry, this won't break your Tolino.
