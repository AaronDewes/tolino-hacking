# A Tolino hacking guide

This site will soon contain some information on how to hack Tolino e-readers.
This isn't an official Tolino website and it's in no way affiliated with tolino media.

### What you'll find here

- Accessing ADB (*)
- Accessing fastboot (*)
- Opening the developer options (*)
- Viewing hidden information in the settings
- Overwriting the serial number
- Changing the browser start page
- Hopefully more soon

(*): I've only found information regarding this for Android 4.4-based models.

For any permanent change, this page will also explain a way to revert it, so don't worry, this won't break your Tolino.
